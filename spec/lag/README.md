Lag is a simple webapp that takes its time to load a resource, in such a way that the document.readyState will be 'interactive' during the page load.
This is for emulating the conditions where an 'eager' page_load_strategy will behave differently than the default 'normal' strategy.

This is here temporarily and should be dockerized and all that jazz.
